# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Emotional Safety Commitment

In alignment with the **Collaborative Code of Community Practice (CCCP)**, we commit to:

1. **Anxiety Reduction**: Recognize that experimentation requires psychological safety
2. **Reversibility**: All changes can be undone within 48 hours
3. **Blameless Post-Mortems**: Learn from mistakes without punishment
4. **Consent-Based Participation**: Respect boundaries and opt-in decision making
5. **Emotional Temperature Monitoring**: Regular check-ins on community well-being

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- **Experimenting freely** within TPCF perimeters
- **Asking for help** without fear of judgment
- **Celebrating mistakes** as learning opportunities
- **Providing context** for decisions and changes

### Unacceptable Behaviors

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment

- **Shaming** contributors for mistakes or lack of experience
- **Demanding immediate responses** or unpaid emotional labor
- **Violating reversibility** by making irreversible changes without consent
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)

This project uses TPCF to balance emotional safety with security:

### Perimeter 1: Core Maintainers
- **Access**: Write access to `main` branch
- **Trust**: Cryptographic verification (GPG signatures)
- **Emotional Safety**: Highest - mistakes are learning opportunities
- **Entry**: Invitation-only after 6+ months of Perimeter 2 contributions

### Perimeter 2: Trusted Contributors
- **Access**: Read-write to feature branches, can approve MRs
- **Trust**: Established history (10+ merged contributions)
- **Emotional Safety**: High - can experiment freely
- **Entry**: Graduated from Perimeter 3 after demonstrated reliability

### Perimeter 3: Community Sandbox
- **Access**: Fork + pull request workflow
- **Trust**: Anyone can participate
- **Emotional Safety**: Complete - zero risk of breaking production
- **Entry**: Automatic - open to all

**Current Project**: Perimeter 3 (Community Sandbox) - fully open contribution

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
conduct@oblibeny.org.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Reversibility in Enforcement

In keeping with our reversibility principle:
- Temporary bans can be appealed after 30 days
- Permanent bans can be reviewed after 1 year
- All enforcement actions are documented transparently
- Appeals are handled by rotating panel of 3 community members
