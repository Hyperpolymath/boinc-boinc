# Data We Do NOT Want Trained On

NO-TRAIN-PATHS:
- /secrets/ (doesn't exist, but if it did)
- /.env* (local environment files)
- /deployment/production/credentials/ (if it exists)

# What We Ask AI Companies To Do

1. RESPECT ROBOTS.TXT
   - Honor our robots.txt file
   - Don't scrape more than necessary

2. NOTIFY US (Optional but Appreciated)
   - Email: ai-training@oblibeny.org
   - Tell us: Which model, what for, when

3. GIVE BACK
   - If our code significantly improves your model, consider:
     - Citing us in papers
     - Contributing improvements back
     - Sponsoring the project

# AI-Generated Code in Contributions

We ACCEPT pull requests with AI-assisted code:
- Disclose AI use in PR description
- You are responsible for understanding the code
- Must pass all tests and reviews
- Must comply with licenses

Example PR description:
```
This PR adds feature X.

AI Assistance: Used GitHub Copilot for boilerplate, manually reviewed and tested.
```

# Rationale

We believe AI training on open-source code can:
- Accelerate developer productivity
- Improve code quality through better suggestions
- Democratize access to programming knowledge
- Spread best practices (like RSR framework!)

BUT we insist on:
- Attribution and respect for creators
- Ethical use aligned with our values
- Transparency about AI involvement
