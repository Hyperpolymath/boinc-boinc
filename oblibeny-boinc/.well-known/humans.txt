  BOINC Platform for Distributed Verification

  "The first programming language developed with
   the cooperation of a global supercomputer"

/* PHILOSOPHY */

Reversibility: All changes can be undone
Attribution: Credit those who came before
Emotional Safety: No fear, only learning
Distributed Trust: No single point of control
Offline-First: Works without the cloud
Political Autonomy: No platform lock-in

/* FUN FACTS */

- Built in a single extended autonomous AI session
- ~100k tokens of Claude Code output
- 60+ production files created
- 5000+ lines of code
- 10000+ lines of documentation
- 0% test coverage (oops! TODO)
- 100% belief in the vision
