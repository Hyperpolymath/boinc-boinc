== Overview

The Oblibeny BOINC Platform operates under a *Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework (TPCF)* combined with principles of *Mutually Assured Accountability (MAA)*. This governance model balances openness with security, enabling community participation while maintaining quality and safety standards.

== Core Principles

=== 1. Distributed Trust

No single point of failure in governance. Decisions require consensus from multiple Perimeter 1 maintainers.

=== 2. Reversibility

All governance decisions can be reversed if they prove harmful. We learn from mistakes without fear.

=== 3. Transparency

Decision-making processes are documented publicly. Financial transactions are auditable.

=== 4. Meritocracy with Safety

Advancement based on demonstrated contributions, but never at the expense of community safety or well-being.

=== 5. Emotional Safety

Psychological safety is paramount. Blameless post-mortems, constructive feedback, and assuming good faith.

== Decision-Making Process

=== Routine Decisions

*Scope*: Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor refactoring

*Process*:
. Perimeter 3 submits MR
. Perimeter 2 reviews (2 approvals required)
. Merge

*Timeline*: 1-7 days

=== Significant Decisions

*Scope*: New features, dependency additions, architecture changes

*Process*:
. RFC (Request for Comments) opened as issue
. Community discussion (minimum 7 days)
. Perimeter 1 review
. Consensus vote (simple majority of Perimeter 1)
. Implementation proceeds

*Timeline*: 2-4 weeks

=== Major Decisions

*Scope*: Breaking changes, license changes, governance changes, mergers/partnerships

*Process*:
. RFC with detailed rationale
. Community discussion (minimum 30 days)
. Perimeter 2 vote (advisory, 2/3 majority)
. Perimeter 1 vote (binding, 3/4 majority)
. Public announcement
. Implementation roadmap

*Timeline*: 1-3 months

=== Emergency Decisions

*Scope*: Security vulnerabilities, legal threats, infrastructure outages

*Process*:
. Any Perimeter 1 can act unilaterally
. Notify other Perimeter 1 within 1 hour
. Public disclosure within 24 hours (or when safe)
. Post-mortem within 7 days
. Community retrospective

*Timeline*: Immediate

== Conflict Resolution

=== Step 1: Direct Communication

Parties attempt to resolve disagreement privately via:
* Matrix/Discord DM
* Email
* Video call

=== Step 2: Mediation

If unresolved after 7 days:
* Assign neutral Perimeter 1 mediator
* Facilitated discussion
* Document perspectives

=== Step 3: Arbitration

If still unresolved:
* Present to all Perimeter 1
* Each side presents case (written + optional presentation)
* Perimeter 1 votes (simple majority)
* Decision is binding but can be appealed after 90 days

=== Step 4: Code of Conduct Enforcement

If CoC violation suspected:
* Report to conduct@oblibeny.org
* Confidential investigation
* Enforcement per link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc]

== Financial Governance

=== Budget Authority

[cols="1,2,1", options="header"]
|===
| Amount (USD) | Authority | Approval Required

| < $100
| Any Perimeter 1
| Post-hoc notification

| $100 - $1,000
| Any Perimeter 1
| 2/3 Perimeter 1 approval

| $1,000 - $10,000
| Treasury lead
| 3/4 Perimeter 1 approval

| > $10,000
| Treasury lead
| Unanimous Perimeter 1 + community RFC

=== Income Sources

* Individual donations (https://liberapay.com/oblibeny[Liberapay], https://opencollective.com/oblibeny[OpenCollective])
* Organizational sponsorships
* Grants (research, FOSS, sustainability)

. Legal and compliance

=== Transparency

* Monthly financial reports published
* All transactions > $100 disclosed

  - Community support
* Reputation visible on contributor profiles
* Used for advancement, not punishment

=== Monitoring

* All repository actions logged
* Security-sensitive actions (release, secrets) require 2FA

* Annual governance review

=== Obligations

[cols="1,2,1", options="header"]
|===
| Role | Obligation | Accountability

== Formal Verification of Governance

*Aspiration*: Encode governance rules in Lean 4 to formally verify:
