## Decision Making

### Consensus Model
- **Small decisions**: Component maintainer decides
- **Medium decisions**: Affected maintainers reach consensus
- **Large decisions**: All Perimeter 1 maintainers vote (2/3 majority)
- **Deadlock**: Project lead has tie-breaking vote

### What Requires Consensus?
- Adding new dependencies
- Changing build system
- Modifying license
- Adding new perimeter rules
- Promoting contributors between perimeters

### Emergency Decisions
- Security issues: Any Perimeter 1 can act, notify others within 24h
- Downtime: On-call rotation handles immediately
- Code of Conduct violations: Any maintainer can take action

## Stepping Down

Maintainers can step down at any time:
1. Notify other maintainers
2. Transfer responsibilities (2 week transition period)
3. Remain in emeritus status (can return)
4. Update MAINTAINERS.md

## Inactive Maintainers

If a maintainer is unresponsive for:
- **30 days**: Gentle ping to check status
- **60 days**: Redistribute review load to other maintainers
- **90 days**: Move to inactive status, remove write access
- Can return anytime by notifying team
