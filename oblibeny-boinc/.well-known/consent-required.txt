# HTTP 430 Consent Required
# This file documents our consent-based approach to data collection

# What is HTTP 430?
# HTTP 430 is a proposed status code for "Consent Required"
# indicating that the server requires explicit user consent before
# processing personal data or tracking.

# Our Consent Philosophy
#
# We follow Privacy by Design principles:
# 1. Minimize data collection (collect only what's necessary)
# 2. Explicit consent (never implicit or dark patterns)
# 3. Easy opt-out (one-click, no account required)
# 4. Data portability (export your data anytime)
# 5. Right to erasure (delete your data completely)

# What We Collect
#
# Anonymous Usage Statistics:
#   - Page views (no IP addresses stored)
#   - Feature usage (e.g., parser invocations)
#   - Error rates (for debugging)
#   - Performance metrics
#
# BOINC Volunteer Data:
#   - Computer specifications (for work distribution)
#   - Computation results
#   - Credit and statistics
#   - Email (optional, for account recovery)
#
# Developer Contributions:
#   - Git commits (public by nature)
#   - Issue/MR comments
#   - Username and display name

# What We DON'T Collect
#
# ❌ No tracking cookies
# ❌ No third-party analytics (Google Analytics, etc.)
# ❌ No advertising identifiers
# ❌ No behavioral profiling
# ❌ No location data (except IP-based country for statistics)
# ❌ No biometric data
# ❌ No social media integration (no "Sign in with..." buttons)

# Consent Types
#
# 1. Essential (No consent needed - necessary for service):
#   - Session cookies (temporary, deleted after logout)
#   - CSRF tokens (security)
#   - Language preference
#
# 2. Functional (Opt-in consent):
#   - Remember login (persistent cookie)
#   - User preferences
#   - Theme settings
#
# 3. Analytics (Opt-in consent):

#   - Error reporting
#   - Performance monitoring
#
# 4. Third-party (Explicit consent per service):
#   - External API calls
#   - CDN usage (we self-host to avoid this)
